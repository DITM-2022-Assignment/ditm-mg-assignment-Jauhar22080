        <p>One of the first ways we will be affected by trash is that our fish will 
          start eating trash therefore causing our fish to be toxic and unhealthy for us to
          eat. This will then mean when we cook the fish we catch it could cause food
          poisoning and we will be more likely to get sick. Another problem with ocean trash is
          that our natural marine life will start to die off as trash starts to pollute
          the enviroment. One not often talked about reason ocean trash is bad is becuase the 
          ocean actually produces appromixatly 50% of the air we breath so if we were to pollute the 
          ocean it would affect the air we breathe causing it to be more toxic. Links to 
          more detalied explanations of the effects of ocean trash can be found on the next page.

      <p>The image on the left tells us about the current statistics of what percentage of fish are found 
        with trash inside of them.
      </p>
      <p>The image to the right tells us the amount of plastic in fish caught in 2010 in fiji and australia.
        Basically what the graph is saying is that in 2010 around 28% of Australia's caught fish
      had 1 piece of plastic in them. And the rest should be self-explanatory.</p>
